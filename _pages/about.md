ðŸŽ“ I am currently a first-year graduate student in **Computer Engineering** at **Northwestern University**, focusing on **Computer Vision**, **Vision-Language Models**, and **Embodied Agents**. Previously, I worked in the **Machine Vision and Robotics Laboratory** mentored by [Prof. Kechen Song](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/songkc/en/index.htm) at **Northeastern University**, where I obtained my bachelor's degree in **Intelligent Manufacturing Engineering**.

ðŸ¦¾ I am now an intern at the **MLL Lab**, under the supervision of [Prof. Manling Li](https://limanling.github.io/). Meanwhile, I am also exploring Ph.D. opportunities.
